short-description: "Audio reactive drum LED system"
full-description: "Designed for band Boston's 2017 HyperSpace Tour, this system triggers LEDS on every drum hit. The system is low-profile, waterproof, and extensively stress-tested for any conditions on the road. An on-board, high-contrast OLED screen allows settings to be customized on the fly, and noise thresholds adjusted and saved for any number of drummers."
